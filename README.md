# G-MitigationForBlogs
Tips and Scripts to Assist Bloggers To Minimize the Chaos on their Blogs With Death of G+

As we all know G+ is going to the great bitbucket in the sky April 2, 2019.

Google is trying to shoo us out the door before they have finishe fixing the issues with Google Takeout.

February 4/5, 2019 they deleted all G+ comments from blogs on Blogger. They gave no means of saveing the data for those comments or converting them to Blogger comments. There is nothing we can do about that.

Those of us who not use **Blogger** have more time to deal with our G+ comments. For **WordPress** users, you can go to your All Comments page in your Admin area and use the search field for **"plus.google.com"**. If you have more than a few, it will be more of a challenge. I only had two so I fixed those manually.

**My manual method is this:

I edited each article and added this text at the end:

[EDIT: Google is deleting all G+ comments to non-blogger blogs. Below is one of two G+ comments on my blog I want to save. 02/06/2019]

* I then pasted in the comment,
* The Date,
* The Commenter's name, 
* and the link to the G+ site.

I left the link text as the original G+ page, but I used the Internet Archive URL for the link. (See the **Internet Archive page** in this repository.)

You can search for the same phrase, **"plus.google.com"**, to find out how many pages have links to G+. I have over 150 total links. I had to ensure that was an accurate count. I had to run an SQL to get a more focused list of posts that I had to decide how to handle. Some on G+ have already left, so there is no way to link to them. Each of you will have to decide how you will handle those. I have not yet decided. For the SQLs I used please see **WordPress Posts**.

Please feel free to add information on how to handle this in other blogging/CRM software. Just clone the repository and make a suggested change or addition. Please see the GitHub help and tutorials for information on how to do this, if you are new to git. I am also new to git and don't have time to explain it. It is very simple and I was creating and handling private repositories in less than an hour. **NOTE:** The gitHub desktop app makes it very easy to work with.

If you have lots of **G+ Content** or want to **archive a Community** you can either use **Google's Takeout**, or the **G+ Exporter**. *(Links and details to be added.)*
